Kent Beck's Test Driven Development By Example
==
## Written In PHP

This repo is simply a learning project. I have read through the book once and conceptually completed the exercises along with Beck. This is my second read through and I decided to make a repo and follow along in php.

### Chapter 10

This repo does stop, currently, at Chapter 10. This is not the ending goal, but a pit stop to push this to a remote repository and collect my thoughts on how to present this to a group of developers as a training course.

### PHPUnit

Use this command to run the tests:

```
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

### PHPDocumentor

Use this command to generate documents:

```
vendor/bin/phpdoc
```
